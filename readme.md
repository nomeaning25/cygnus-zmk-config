## Dactyl Cygnus

This is a fork from [rafaelromao/cygnus-zmk-config](https://github.com/rafaelromao/cygnus-zmk-config). I modified it for my needs and pin arangement.
Also updated the kemap to fit my typing style.

### A 36 keys handwired split keyboard.

### Build Details

Dactyl Cygnus is a handwired board originally designed by @juhakaup and available at [https://github.com/juhakaup/keyboards](https://github.com/juhakaup/keyboards).

### My keyboard layout.

* td_rignt_shift, td_rignt_shift: A tap dance action for letter F to change to sticky left or right shift or enables capslock
* td_home: A tab dance from my Gaming layer to go back to home layer.
* Gaming layer is used for my gaming needs. It disables all homewrow and tap dance anctions, combos and other stuff that would mess with my keypresses
